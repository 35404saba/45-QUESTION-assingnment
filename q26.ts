//• If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
//• If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
//• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
//("run the if block");
